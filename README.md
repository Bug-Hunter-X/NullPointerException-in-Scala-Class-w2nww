# NullPointerException in Scala Class

This repository demonstrates a potential `NullPointerException` in a simple Scala class and provides a solution.

The bug is in the `bug.scala` file.  The solution is presented in `bugSolution.scala`.  The bug arises from not handling the possibility of a null `name` parameter. 

This example underscores the necessity for robust null handling to prevent unexpected runtime errors in Scala applications.
